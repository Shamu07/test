1. typevariableName = Value;

2.no

3.yes

4.no

5.It allows us to pass information or parameters to our Java program from the command line.

6. yes

7.no

8.no

9. 	int[] myArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
	System.out.println(myArray[0]);
	myArray[0] = 10;
	System.out.println(Arrays.toString(myArray)); 


10.error

11. * save the file with the exrension of java
    * compile the file using java compiler,it will convert into the byte code
    * LATER JVM HELPS TO CONVERT INTO MACHINE language and program will excecute

12.  java c convert the source code into byte code 
	java is a high-level language,object oriented programming language, because translation of code takes place into machine language using compiler or interpreter.

13.In Java, a class loader is a part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)  which is responsible for loading Java classes into memory at runtime

14.

15. because it has  primitive data types, we use static keywords 

16
	 JDK : JDK(java development kit) it is a kit which provide the tools, libraries,and component to run the java program.

	JRE: JRE(java Runtime Environment) it is a software package which provides the necessary runtime environment to run java program.
	
	JVM : JVM(java virtual machine) it is a component of java platform which acts as java runtime environment for executing java bytecode.

17.initialization method

18.yes

19java converts the program file to class file that is byte code

20.nothing is going to happen we can write it

21.jvm is java virtual machine which is run time enviroment for compiled java class files it helps computer run program which is written in other language that is later compiled as bytecode

22.A class member is declared with an access modifier to specify how it is accessed by the other classes in Java

23.

24.

25.variable is a container which store the data values

26.heap

27.type variableName = value;
 Where type is one of Java's types  and variableName is the name of the variable 
 equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.

28.it is necessary because compiler checks all the elements

29.byte,int short ,char,boolean,long,float

30 it converts bytecode to machine code

31.its is defined as block of code

32.WORA = write once read anywhere

33.we can check the version in cmd

34.java20

35.it is a blueprint of creating a object

36.object is the instance of class

37.class className { //Body of the class }

38. ClassName object = new ClassName();

39.it is used to create the instances of class
